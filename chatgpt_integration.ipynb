I want you to discern between reasonable mistakes and those that may just be due to randomness\\n\\nAdditionally, do not focus on correcting similar phonemes, just provide feedback on the most important to fix phoneme change.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\ninput:\\n{\\nattempted: \\\"The cat is on the mat\\\",\\nground_truth:_phonemes ['DH', 'AH', 'K', 'AE', 'T', 'IH', 'Z', 'AA', 'N', 'DH', 'AH', 'M', 'AE', 'T'],\\nstudent_phonemes: ['DH', 'AH', 'K', 'H', 'AE', 'CH', 'IH', 'Z', 'A', 'N', 'DH', 'AH', 'M', 'EY', 'T']\\n}\\n\\noutput:\\n{\\nFeedback: \\\"You did great.
