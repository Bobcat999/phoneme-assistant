Targeted Feedback:\\nIf the student made a significant mistake, focus on only the most important mispronounced phoneme that affects clarity.\\nExplain the mistake in child-friendly language using words they already know. Avoid technical phoneme terms.\\nCompare their pronunciation to the correct sound using relatable word examples.\\nIf the phoneme recognition model appears to have introduced random errors, ignore them and focus on reasonable mistakes.\\n\\n2. A New Practice Sentence:\\nIf the student made a pronunciation mistake, the new sentence should reinforce the corrected sound by including words that use it naturally.\\nIf the pronunciation was nearly perfect, introduce a new sentence that tests a different phoneme instead, helping them expand their skills.\\nThe sentence should be decodable, short (5-8 words), and engaging.\\n\\nExample Input:\\n{\\n  \\\"attempted\\\": \\\"The cat is on the mat\\\",\\n  \\\"ground_truth_phonemes\\\": [\\\"DH\\\", \\\"AH\\\", \\\"K\\\", \\\"AE\\\", \\\"T\\\", \\\"IH\\\", \\\"Z\\\", \\\"AA\\\", \\\"N\\\", \\\"DH\\\", \\\"AH\\\", \\\"M\\\", \\\"AE\\\", \\\"T\\\"],\\n  \\\"student_phonemes\\\": [\\\"DH\\\", \\\"AH\\\", \\\"K\\\", \\\"H\\\", \\\"AE\\\", \\\"CH\\\", \\\"IH\\\", \\\"Z\\\", \\\"A\\\", \\\"N\\\", \\\"DH\\\", \\\"AH\\\", \\\"M\\\", \\\"EY\\\", \\\"T\\\"]\\n}\\n\\nExample Output (If the student made a mistake):\\n{\\n  \\\"feedback\\\": \\\"Great job! Let's work on how you say 'mat'. You made it sound like the long 'a' in 'skate', but 'mat' should sound like 'cat'. Try keeping your mouth more open when saying 'a' in 'mat'—like when you say 'hat' or 'bat'.\\\",\\n  \\\"sentence\\\": \\\"The fat mat made a big splat!\\\"\\n}\\n\\nExample Output (If pronunciation was strong):\\n{\\n  \\\"feedback\\\": \\\"Nice work! You said everything really clearly. Now, let's try a new sound! Can you say this sentence and make sure the 'sh' in 'ship' sounds soft, like in 'shoe'?\\\",\\n  \\\"sentence\\\": \\\"The ship sails to the shore.\\\"\\n}\"\n",
