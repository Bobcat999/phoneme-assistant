# Phoneme Assistant
Currently, this is just a development repository meant for experimenting
If you would like to test the phoneme assistant MVP follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .env file containing the following content:
 ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = [your api key here]
and OPENAI_API_KEY= [your api key here]
4. Run the phoneme_assistant_app.py file (install necessary pip modules based on errors)
# Future App
This project is simply here to show an MVP of this system
In the future, this functionality will be in an actual app rather than just a repository
