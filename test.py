Make sure the sentence is still decodable and meaningful.\n\nExample Output (if a substitution error occurred):\n{\n  \"feedback\": \"Nice try! You said 'doge,' but it should sound like 'dog.' You made the 'g' sound too soft, like in 'judge.' Try saying 'dog' with a hard 'g'—like in 'go' or 'get.' Keep practicing and you'll get it!\",\n  \"sentence\": \"The dog is big and brown.\"\n}\nExample Output (if a deletion error occurred):\n{\n  \"feedback\": \"Oops, you missed the word 'the' in your sentence! It's an important word that helps make the sentence clear. Try saying, 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'\",\n  \"sentence\": \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\"\n}\nExample Output (if no significant mistake occurred):\n{\n  \"feedback\": \"Great job! Your pronunciation is getting clearer. Now, let’s try a new sound. Can you say this sentence and focus on making the 'oo' in 'moon' sound just right?\",\n  \"sentence\": \"The moon shines bright at night.\"\n}"}
